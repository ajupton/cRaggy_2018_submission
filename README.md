# cRaggy Submission 
My submission to the Cascadia R Conf cRaggy is designed to show the overall topology of the Biketown Network. I explore hub to hub interactions and model edge weight (or strength of bike trips between any two given hubs) based on color - a colder (more dark blue) color represents a stronger weight. I use the cold color scheme to contrast against the Nike orange hubs.

Thanks to the organizers of the Cascadia R Conf!
